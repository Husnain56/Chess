# HOW TO PLAY

White pieces always make the first move, and players take turns commanding their unique pieces. To move, simply click a piece and then the square you want it to occupy. Outsmart your opponent and deliver checkmate! Checkmate happens when their king is under direct attack (in check) with no escape. Remember, capturing enemy pieces along the way can give you a strategic advantage.
